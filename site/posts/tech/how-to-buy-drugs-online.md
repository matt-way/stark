Drugs are great fun for the whole family. However, if your choice is outside the mainstream legal stimuli like music, alcohol, or sports, and packed into that hypocritical "illicit" basket, then you have come to the right place.

So below is a detailed step by step for converting your enslaving fiat dollars, into life changing brain hacks like MDMA and LSD.
