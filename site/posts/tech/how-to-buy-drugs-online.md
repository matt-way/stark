Drugs are great fun for the whole family. However, if your choice is outside the mainstream legal stimuli like music, alcohol, or sports, and packed into that hypocritical "illicit" basket, then you have come to the right place. Even if you have heard of sites like Silk Road, you may not know how to access them, or more importantly know how to minimise risk while using them. 

It's probably a mixture of my coding background, or constant cryptocurrency championing banter, but more people have been asking me how they would go about purchasing the means to some next level experiences online. So below is a detailed step by step for converting your enslaving fiat dollars, into life changing brain hacks like MDMA and LSD. Imagine having high quality, reasonably priced drugs delivered straight to your door, while at the same time reducing [real] crime and making the world a better place.

The process written below is entirely hypothetical, and was put together using my own research, with the help of many anonymous people online. I hopefully don't have to spell out the fact that are risks involved if you decide to follow these instructions.

####Tor and Anonymity

The first thing you need to learn about is being anonymous online. What this means is obfuscating your IP address so that it is difficult for any sites you are visiting to know your origin. To access online darknet sites, you need to use a tool like Tor. [Go to the Tor Project website] and download and install the client. To the user, Tor is essentially just a regular web browser, but operates over a worldwide network of computers that help bounce around and encrypt your IP address. The cost of this anonymity is speed, so don't fret if sites take quite a while to load, or require a refresh. 

While I believe this is enough anonymity, you can also take the further step of employing a VPN. A VPN is essentially a service where you rent a computer anywhere in the world to be your first port of call when using the internet. The information is usually encrypted, so it prevents your internet service provider from seeing that you are using things like the Tor network. There are many VPNs to choose from, and they all vary in cost and features. [HideMyAss](https://www.hidemyass.com/) is one example.

[Go to the Tor Project website]: https://www.torproject.org/

Now when you open the Tor client, please follow these instructions carefully:

> DO NOT use any information, such as usernames, passwords or accounts that you use during regular day to day internet usage. DO NOT log into facebook, or any social network. Tor is not perfect, and any information you provide through Tor could potentially be used to help track you down.

The best idea is to create brand new user names, passwords and personal details that you use exclusively while on Tor. You will need to create a few sets, so that you can use each one on the different services that are outlined further in this article. Think of this as creating a handful of brand new, clean online identities, that have absolutely no relationship to you or each other. If you need to make a note of any of this information, **write it all down physically, on a piece of paper**. That way, it is easy to destroy any connection between you and these identities in the event of an emergency.


####Darknet Marketplaces

![Agora marketplace](/images/1.png)

The main thing Tor allows you to do is access **.onion** websites. Silk Road is an example of this sort of site, but there are others like Agora, Hydra, etc. DeepDotWeb has a constantly updated list with many of these online marketplaces ([Check them out here]). Unlike regular websites, these marketplaces have more obscure names (eg. *agorahooawayyfoe.onion/register/Gc2h4eoFAE*) and can also change regularly, so don't assume any bookmarked urls are accurate, or will work. Other than the weird names, you open these sites the same way as any other, by putting the url in your Tor browser address bar.

You may have to look through multiple marketplaces to find both what you are looking for, and the right price/quality/servicable location, etc. So with your newly invented identities, explore away! Just beware, people are always setting up fake copycat sites, attempting to phish for your usernames and passwords. So always do your research before entering information, and as I will talk about further along, don't store money for any reason at all on these sites.

####Bitcoins

I am sure you have heard of bitcoins by now (but may have no idea what they really are). If you don't, just think of them as online gold. A mathematically ensured finite digital resource that get their value from popularity and utility. If that was too big a mouthful, just think of them as digital money that isn't tied to any bank. This makes them a perfect candidate for anonymous purchasing of goods.

Bitcoins are stored in digital wallets that are cryptographically signed. This simply means that a wallet requires a really complex password to be able to access and use it. What you need to do next is create a wallet to store your bitcoins you will use for purchasing. To do this, use a decent online service like [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info/wallet). While using your Tor browser go to [this site](http://blockchain.info/wallet) and sign up for a new wallet. You will need an email address to verify your account, so create a brand new email using [gmail](http://gmail.com) or [outlook](http://outlook.com), using one of the identities you have invented. Remember to do all of this through Tor. If you want to read further into the security of a service like blockchain, [this link] has good information.

[this link]: http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/5249/how-secure-is-blockchain-info

You are likely now thinking, how do you actually get bitcoins to put in your wallet? Well you simply need another person with bitcoins to transfer some of theirs into your wallet. The tricky part is doing this so that the sender has no idea who you are. There is this great site for public bitcoin trading called [localbitcoins.com](http://localbitcoins.com). Again, using Tor, go to this site and create a new account using one of your invented identities. You will need to supply an email address for this part too, so although tedious, create another new email address to use with this account. This ensures the two services cannot be associated. Sometimes to make trades, you will need to verify your localbitcoin account with a phone number. To do this anonymously, just use a service like [receive-sms-online.com](http://receive-sms-online.com/). These sites provide a list of mobile numbers that the public can use to get sms anonymously. If you need a number from a specific country, you will have to search for alternative sites until you find one.

Once you have an account, you can instantiate a trade. Do not use bank tansfer, or trade in person for obvious reasons. The safest way is to do a bank deposit with cash. Many traders use this method, and provide details of the account to which you need to deposit, and a reference number to provide, so they know it was your localbitcoin account that deposited the money. Just make sure you deal with users with decent ratings to avoid any scams.

This is the point where I should also explain what [escrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow) is. Localbitcoins use escrow, and so do many of the online marketplaces. Essentially this means that any money that changes hands is held by a third party until both parties are satisfied that everything went according to plan. It isn't perfect, but does help avoid some bad situations. So once you have made your trade, take some cash to the right bank, deposit the money, and verify it was sent while still on Tor. This will place the bitcoins temporarily in your localbitcoin account. You need to deposit these bitcoins into the wallet you created above through your localbitcoin account page. Congratulations, you now have bitcoins in a relatively untraceable wallet.

You may be wondering why you even needed to create the second wallet at all. Why not just use the localbitcoin account wallet, as that was also setup anonymously? Well there is still a minute chance that your photo was taken while you were depositing the cash at the bank. By moving the money into this separate wallet, even if by some ridiculously remote chance you could be tied to your localbitcoin account, this creates another level of separation and deniability (eg. "I don't know who owns that wallet").

####Buying Goods Online

Now all you have to do is find what you want to purchase. Reading the seller feedback left by other customers is a good rating indicator. Make sure that the seller has a good rating, and that they are happy to mail goods to your country (if buying internationally). Buying locally is by far the safest and quickest option, but depending on where you are located, it is sometimes much cheaper to look overseas. Make sure the seller uses top notch concealment practices (usually labelled as [stealth](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1eusom/what_in_your_experience_defines_good_stealth/)). Finally, and most importantly, **buy in small quantities**. This will increase the likelihood that they will arrive, as well as making any attempt to come after you completely impractical.

I should also note that some sellers require that you FE (finalise early). This is also related to escrow as mentioned above. FE basically means that you end the escrow process early, releasing funds to the seller before you have ensured that your goods have arrived. You should try and avoid FE as much as possible, and only do it for sellers that have a very high rating (although even then there have been unfortunate incidents in the past). Just remember, if you do use full escrow, it is up to you to release the funds in a timely manner. Forgetting to do this demeans the entire escrow process. 

When you find what you want to purchase you will need to deposit bitcoins into your marketplace account wallet. Only do this when you are completely sure what you want to purchase, and only deposit the amount you want to spend. Due to the highly fluctuating price of bitcoin, it can be a good idea to deposit slightly more than you need, as it takes time for the transfer to process, and you don't want to be left slightly short and have to transfer again. Once your marketplace account has a useful balance, you will need to enter the delivery address and complete the trade.

####PGP Encryption and a Successful Delivery

> Do not enter your address in plain text on these marketplace sites.

Every legitimate seller provides a public encryption key (PGP Key) that you can use to encrypt your address, or any other text communication you need to make with the seller. Encrypting text is easy once you learn how to use the right tools. One example tool is called [Kleopatra](http://www.kde.org/applications/utilities/kleopatra/), for which I have included a simple tutorial video below. Basically, you take a text file containing your text you want to encrypt (in this case your address), and a text file that contains the sellers public key, and combine them to make new encrypted text. You then paste this text in the address box of the marketplace when you make a purchase.

As there are different tools available for different operating systems, this part may take a little bit of research on your part. The benefit is that you will be able to send encrypted messages between you and anyone you want in the future, a skill that most people should learn at some stage.

You may be wondering who exactly do you address your packages to? Well it should be obvious by now not to use your actual name. The best option is to use the name of a previous occupant for which you already receive mail for. You may even already have a small pile of mail addressed to different people sitting in your house, just in case they ever contact you requesting it. When your package arrives you should place it with this other mail temporarily. This is so that in the event you receive an unwanted knock at the door, you have absolutely "no idea" what was those packages.
