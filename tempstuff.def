Drugs are great fun for the whole family. However, if your choice is outside the mainstream legal stimuli like music, alcohol, or sports and packed into that hypocritical "illicit" basket, then you have come to the right place. Given my computer science background, and constant cryptocurrency championing banter, it makes sense that people have been asking me how they would go about purchasing the means to some next level experiences online. So below is a detailed step by step for converting your enslaving fiat dollars into life changing brain hacks like MDMA and LSD. Imagine having high quality, reasonably priced drugs delivered straight to your door, while at the same time reducing [real] crime and simply making the world a better place. :)

Before I begin, there are some quick disclaimers. This post is made with Australians in mind, but still should apply on the most part to anyone. Purchasing illegal items has its risks. I attempt to shed light on how you would go about mitigating these risks, but there is obviously no guarantee. While the quality of online purchases is high due to rating and feedback based systems, until we smartly allow professional regulated chemists to make this stuff, you ultimately don't know what you are getting. So test if possible.

Right, with that out the way, lets break the steps down first:

1. Creating your anonymous online identity
2. Getting Bitcoins
3. Finding a market place, and knowing what to look for
4. Making a purchase
5. Risks

It might be a long read, but I suggest going through the entire thing before deciding to go ahead. I try and address potential issues and raise red flags where appropriate, so this should make it easier to weigh the risks. Let's begin.

Software & Online Anonymity

Your initial goal when purchasing drugs online is for no one to be able to associate your computer with the market place websites you visit, and online purchases you make. So the first thing you are going to do is invent a few unique username and password pairs that are in no way related to anything else you have ever done on the internet. Commit these to memory (or write them down, but keep them somewhere safe, and easily destroyable). 

The next thing you need to do, is setup a special browser that helps keep your IP address (your computers digital address on the internet) disassociated with the sites you visit. To do this, as well as be able to access most of the underground market places online, download the Tor Browser here^. This type of browser makes it extremely difficult to associate your computer with the sites you visit while using it. The technology is an entire topic unto itself, but check out this link^ https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en if you want to read more. There are installation instructions included on the download page, which would be wise to follow. Once you load Tor Browser, you will notice it has assigned you a new IP address that websites will think is you. Before you type any URL in the address bar, make sure you follow this imperative rule: DO NOT use this browser for anything that could relate its use back to you. No facebook, or any site for that matter you have previously provided any personal information to. Tor is not foolproof, and your traffic could most definitely be monitored by a 3rd party (even if they don't know where it came from). 

Download and install the Tor browser bundle from here: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en . 

Getting Bitcoins

If you haven't heard of bitcoin you need to get in more. I'd be surprised if you understood all of its intricacies, but if you are really unsure, just think of it as digital money on the internet. It is useful for this type of endevour, because it has similar anonymity to cash, but with the digital utility of being able to easily transact all over the world instantly. To get bitcoins you are going to need a Bitcoin wallet. You can think of this as a sort of bank account, but the bank can literally be anywhere. The goal here is that you want to create a wallet, and put bitcoins in it, but not be able to trace either back to you.

There are a few different ways to get a wallet. You can become part of the bitcoin network itself, storing wallets on your own computer, however this requires downloading bitcoins entire transactional records. The quickest, and relatively safe way is to create an online wallet at http://blockchain.info/wallet . Go to this site inside your Tor browser and create an account using one of your username/password pairs you thought up earlier.

once a wallet is setup, you need to trade real money for bitcoins. The best way to do this anonymously is to use the site localbitcoins.com . This is a marketplace where people from all over the world trade real currencies and bitcoin. Again using the Tor browser, create a new account on this site using a different username/password pair from your wallet account. Next click on the buy bitcoins button, and type in your general location, like the capital city you are in. This will present you with a list of potential people who are willing to trade, and the price they are asking.
